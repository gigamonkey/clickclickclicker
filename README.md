# Click click clicker

This project provides the skeleton for a clicker game. You goal is to
enhance this game to make it more interesting. The HTML in
`index.html` is very basic so you can make it look more interesting.
There is almost no styling in `style.css` so once you're ready to
learn about CSS there's plenty to do there. And the game itself is
currently quite boring.

Note that the file `clicker.js` can probably be left alone. It's worth
taking a look at but I don't expect you to understand everything in
there. There are, however, extensive comments so you should be able to
get at least some idea of what's going on.

The main code for the game, and where you will want to make
enhancements is in `game.js`. Comments in that file and in
`clicker.js`
