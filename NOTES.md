- Create new HTML/CSS/JS replit.
- Look at the generated `index.html` and notice the lines
  ```
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  ```
  and
  ```
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  ```
- Look at `style.js` and notice that it's empty. This is here you will do most of you work, writing Javascript code to manipulate the HTML document (and possibly it's CSS).
- Look at `script.css`. Also empty. You don't need to do anything here until you get to the point of wanting to making things look nice. But when you do, this is where you'll do it.
